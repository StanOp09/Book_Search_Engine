# Book Search Engine using MERN

## Description
As a web developer it is imperative to satisfy front end and back end demands of user clients. Data is a key driver of web development and the ability to personalize user data forms the bedrock of real-world web development today and applications need to keep up with growing trends. 

This project focuses on meeting those demands by building a fully functioning [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) search engine with RESTful API. Utilities used include [GraphQL API](https://graphql.org) built with [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/); MERN stack with a [React](https://react.dev) frontend, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) database, and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)/[Express.js](https://expressjs.com) server and API. Applciation was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) database using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database).
